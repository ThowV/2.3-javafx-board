# Game board framework

A framework for creating grid-based board games using JavaFX.  
This project includes two simple premade board games: Reversi and Tic Tac Toe.  
Both board games can be found in the [premades package](https://github.com/ThowV/game-board-framework/tree/master/src/main/java/com/thowv/javafxgridgameboard/premades) and be seen used in the [examples package](https://github.com/ThowV/game-board-framework/tree/master/src/main/java/com/thowv/javafxgridgameboard/examples).
